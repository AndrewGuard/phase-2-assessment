# Request &amp; Response Cycle

Explain what happens when someone enters a URL into the browser and a web page "magically" appears half a second-or-so later.  Be as detailed as you're comfortable being and please mention what parts you don't know or aren't clear about.

Describe it using whatever medium you feel most comfortable.  Write a small essay, draw a few pictures, make a diagram, use code or a fully-functioning application to illustrate your points, etc.  Talk about it to us as you think and talk about it to yourself.
