Authenticated Comments AJAX
=============================

Alright, so you have just finished writing an app for authenticated comment posting.  Make a copy of your app for this second problem.

For this problem, you will be replacing your normal forms with AJAX forms for posting a comment.  When the comment is successfully posted, it should appear at the top of the list of comments.  If there is an error, a popup should appear saying "Ooops!  Something went wrong!".
