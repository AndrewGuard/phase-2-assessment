Anonymous AJAX Comments
=============================

In this challenge, we will focus on using AJAX.

Our goal will be to create a website with a single page: it has a form, where anyone can submit an anonymous comment via AJAX, and we can see a list of comments.

When the comment is successfully posted, it should appear at the top of the list of comments.
If there is an error, a popup should appear saying "Ooops!  Something went wrong!".

A basic form has already been given that posts to '/comments'.
This route will create the comment and return a JSON response.
Feel free to edit or re-write this code if you prefer.
