Phase 2 Assessment
==================

Hello again! You know the drill.  These challenges have been designed to assess what you've been learning over the past three weeks during Phase 2 of Dev Bootcamp.

You'll have about 55 minutes to work through the problems in this repository. We suggest that you read through all of the problems first before starting on any of them. If you don't know how to solve one of them, or if you get stuck, simply move on to the next one. Don't waste time spinning your wheels -- **move on and just get as much done as possible**.

There are 4 different problems. You'll be working for about 40 minutes on your own, after which point your interviewer will sit and pair with you for the last 15 minutes. Again -- work on what you know first.

**NOTE:** Simply work on your solutions on the computer you're working on. Then, your interviewer will review it with you. Please note also, that **after the interview is over, you should delete your code**.

**Good luck!**
