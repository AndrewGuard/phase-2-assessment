Errors and Debugging
====================

# Introduction

Software has bugs (surprise, surprise). By now you should be familiar with errors in Ruby and how to use them to debug your code. This problem will give you a chance to demonstrate your proficiency with debugging.

# Your Mission

In this folder, you'll find some code. The code, however, is currently non-functional. That is, it has errors. You need to find and fix the errors. You should start by installing the required gems:

```bash
$ bundle install  # this will install the required gems
```

After that, run the code, and then:

1. Find the error.
2. Fix it.
3. Rinse, lather, repeat (go to step 1).

To run the code:

```bash
$ ruby driver.rb  # the 'bundle exec' makes sure the gems are loaded
```

**NOTE:** The first two errors in the code should be fairly straight-forward to debug. The third error may be a bit less obvious. If you get stuck, **move on**.
