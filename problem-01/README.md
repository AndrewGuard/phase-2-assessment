Authenticated Comments
======================

# Introduction

By now you should be familiar with basic sinatra apps and creating simple websites.  This problem will give you a chance to demonstrate your proficiency with the web by writing code for controllers, authentication, views, and basic HTML forms with a little bit of CSS.

You have been given the sinatra skeleton app with the database already setup for Users and Comments.
Feel free to look at the models and the migrations.

# Your Mission

We want to create a wall of comments, similar to someone's facebook wall.
You need to add the following functionality to the sinatra skeleton:

  * a user can sign up, sign in and sign out.
  * logged in users can create comments
  * any user can view the list comments (most recent at the top)

Use proper HTML and CSS concepts for your views.

IMPORTANT: Do NOT use AJAX or any javascript.
