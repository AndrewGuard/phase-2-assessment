Authenticated Comments 
====================

# Introduction

By now you should be familiar with basic sinatra skeleton and creating simple websites.  This problem will give you a chance to demonstrate your proficiency with MVC, authentication, and basic forms with a little bit of CSS.

# Your Mission

In the ```sinatra``` folder, you'll find the basic sinatra skeleton.  You need to add the following functionality to it:

  * a user can sign up, sign in and sign out.
  * logged in users can create comments
  * any user can view the list comments (most recent at the top)

Use proper HTML and CSS concepts for your views.

IMPORTANT: Do NOT use AJAX or any javascript.
